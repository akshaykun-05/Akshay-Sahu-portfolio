Backlink Outreach Template & Guidance

Subject: Quick collaboration / feature request for Akshay Sahu's portfolio

Hi [Name],

I'm Akshay Sahu — a full-stack developer and AI/3D artist. I recently published a project/case study on [TOPIC] that I think would be a useful resource for your readers at [SITE].

Quick highlights:
- Practical walkthrough and code samples
- Hosted demo: https://akshaysahu.online/portfolio.html#ConceptForgeAI
- Source code: https://github.com/AkshaySahu05

Would you consider linking to or mentioning this project in your [page/post/resource]? Happy to provide a short blurb or adapt the post to fit your audience.

Thanks for considering — I appreciate the work you do at [SITE].

Best,
Akshay Sahu
