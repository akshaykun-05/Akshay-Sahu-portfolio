Content Plan & Internal Linking for akshaysahu.online

Primary goals
- Rank for: "full-stack developer portfolio", "AI developer portfolio", "3D artist portfolio", "hackathon finalist".
- Drive freelancer leads and GitHub project traffic.

Primary pages to target
- Home (`/`): Hero value prop + links to portfolio, resume, contact.
- Portfolio (`/portfolio.html`): Case studies (one project per sub-section), each with deep technical notes and keywords.
- Blog/Case Studies (recommended new folder `/blog/`): 8-12 long-form posts (1,000-1,800 words) on project postmortems, tutorials, and hackathon journeys.
- Contact: Simple form + microcopy targeting hiring and freelance terms.

Keyword map (prioritized)
1. full-stack developer portfolio (high intent)
2. AI developer portfolio (high)
3. 3D artist web portfolio (medium)
4. hackathon finalist portfolio (medium)
5. webgl three.js portfolio (medium)

Suggested content topics
- Case study: "MasumiGuard — AI + Blockchain for transaction anomaly detection" (1200-1600 words)
- Tutorial: "Deploying serverless AI with AWS Bedrock and CloudFront" (1000-1400 words)
- Project walkthrough: "Real-time 3D dragon shader in WebGL" (1000 words + code snippets)
- Performance post: "Optimizing portfolio for 90+ Lighthouse scores" (800-1200 words)

Internal linking strategy
- Link from Home -> Portfolio (hero CTA) and Portfolio -> each Case Study anchor.
- From each case study, link to related blog posts and GitHub repos.
- Add a site-wide footer link to Contact and Resume (already present).

On-page suggestions per page
- Use H1 for the main title only; use H2 for section headings (About, Projects, Contact).
- Add descriptive alt text to all images (done in many places).
- Add canonical tags where duplicates exist.

Next steps I can take
- Generate a list of 8 content briefs (titles + outlines) and produce the first draft for one case study.
- Scaffold a `/blog/` index and one sample post file in the repo.
